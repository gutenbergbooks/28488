<b>ACT I<br>
SCENE I<br>
<br>
Madame Pernelle and her servant Flipote, Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Damis, Cleante<br>
<br>
Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; Let's go, Flipote, let's go. I hate this place.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.<br>
I don't wish to cause you any bother.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; What duty demands, I insist on giving.<br>
But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .<br>
And no one cares what I wish to have done.<br>
Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied<br>
For all my wise advice has been defied . . .<br>
And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,<br>
And truly this is a home for the king of louts!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; If . . .<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,<br>
A little brazen and very sassy,<br>
You butt into everything to speak your mind.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; But . . .<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You, grandson, are a fool of the worst kind.<br>
It is I, your grandmother, that pronounce this edict<br>
And to my son, your father, I have oft predicted<br>
That you'll turn out to be a worthless wastrel,<br>
And give him in life a foretaste of Hell.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; I think . . .<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lord, his sister! You seem so discreet<br>
And so untainted, so very sweet,<br>
But the stillest waters are filled with scum,<br>
And your sly ways earn my revulsion.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; But . . .<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daughter, my views may make you mad,<br>
But your conduct in all things is all bad.<br>
In your family's eyes you should be an example-setter;<br>
In that respect their late mother did far better.<br>
You are extravagant, and it wounds me, I guess,<br>
To see you sashay about dressed like a princess.<br>
A woman who wishes only to please her mate,<br>
Dear daughter, need not primp and undulate.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Madam, after all . . .<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her brother, as for you,<br>
I respect you, love you, and revere you, too,<br>
But finally, if I were my son, her spouse,<br>
I would at once beg you to leave this house.<br>
Without cease you teach your rules and mottos<br>
Which decent people should never follow.<br>
I now speak frankly, but it is my part;<br>
I never spare the words that stir my heart.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; Your man Tartuffe is satisfied, no fear . . .<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; He is a holy man whom all should hear,<br>
And I cannot bear, without great rue,<br>
To hear him mocked by a fool like you.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; What? Am I myself to bear a carping critic,<br>
A base usurper with a power tyrannic,<br>
Such that we can do nothing for diversion<br>
Without hearing about that creep's aversion?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; If we were to hear and obey his whims,<br>
We couldn't do anything without sins<br>
For he forbids all, this false Capuchin.<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; And everything he forbids is well forbidden.<br>
He strives to guide you on the road to heaven,<br>
And it's my son's duty to make you love him.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; No, grandma, neither dad nor anyone else<br>
Can oblige me to wish for his good health.<br>
I'd be false to myself if I didn't say this:<br>
When I see him around, I begin to get pissed.<br>
I can smell the outcome, and soon this coot<br>
And I will find ourselves in a grand dispute.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; It's certainly a clear cause for remark<br>
When a nobody acts like a patriarch,<br>
A beggar who was barefoot when he came hence<br>
And whose whole wardrobe wasn't worth two cents!<br>
And he's gone so far as to forget his past for<br>
He opposes everything and plays the master.<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; Ah! mercy on me! Things would be better,<br>
If you'd only follow his holy orders.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; He passes for a saint in your fantasy,<br>
But, I swear, he acts with hypocrisy.<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; Watch your tongue!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to him nor his man Laurent<br>
Would I trust my honor without good warrant.<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; I don't know what his servant's like at heart,<br>
But for the man himself, I'll guarantee his part.<br>
You only treat him with hate and aversion<br>
Because he truly strives for your conversion.<br>
He hurls his heart up against each sin<br>
And the glory of God is all he hopes to win.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But why, especially during some<br>
Time past, must he ban all guests from our home?<br>
Can a courtesy call offend Heaven<br>
Enough to merit a huge commotion?<br>
Would you like it explained, just between us? [<i>Gesturing toward Elmire.</i>]<br>
Of Madam there, on my oath, he's jealous!<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; Be quiet, and think before you speak.<br>
Others, too, condemn the company you keep.<br>
All this bustle from the people who arrive,<br>
The carriages ceaselessly parking at curb-side,<br>
And the servants in a circle chattering,<br>
Makes noise that your neighbors find nerve-shattering.<br>
I'd like to think there's no harm meant,<br>
But when gossips talk, they're malevolent.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; How can you hope to stop people talking?<br>
It would truly be most irritating<br>
If, for the sake of idle, foolish chatter,<br>
We must renounce the friends that really matter.<br>
And even if we could resolve to do it,<br>
How could you hope to keep the whole world quiet?<br>
No castle wall can defend against lies,<br>
So let's ignore the fools who criticize,<br>
And strive to live in innocence and ease,<br>
Letting gossips gossip as they please.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Daphne, our neighbor, and her petty spouse--<br>
Weren't they the ones who slandered this house?<br>
Those whom the whole world finds ridiculous<br>
Are always first in line to stick it to us.<br>
They never fail to sniff out and swiftly share<br>
The earliest rumor of a love affair,<br>
Sowing seeds of scandal with eager expedition<br>
And twisting truth past all recognition.<br>
In their own colors, they paint all others,<br>
Brazenly calling all men their brothers;<br>
In the faint hope of finding some resemblance,<br>
They try to give a gloss of innocence<br>
To their schemes or to make others share<br>
The burden of blame that is only theirs.<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; All this hair-splitting is off the subject.<br>
Orante lives a life that is perfect<br>
With all her thoughts on heaven, and I hear<br>
That she deeply mourns the way you live here.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; The lady herself is quite an example!<br>
You want a chaste life?&nbsp; She's a nice sample.<br>
But old age has stuck her in this zealous mood,<br>
And everyone knows she's a reluctant prude.<br>
'Cause as long as she could snare a man's heart,<br>
She was more than willing to play her part.<br>
But now that her eyes have lost their luster,<br>
She leaves the world that already left her<br>
And uses a pompous veil of phony wisdom<br>
To hide the fact that her looks are gone.<br>
It's the last resort of the aging flirt,<br>
So peeved at having no man at her skirt<br>
That, alone and abandoned to solitude,<br>
Her only recourse is to become a prude.<br>
And these good women censure all with such<br>
Great severity; nor do they pardon much.<br>
They biliously blame immorality<br>
Not from charity, but only from envy<br>
That others are drinking in that pleasure<br>
From which old age now drains their measure.<br>
<b>Mme. Pernelle</b> [<i>to Elmire</i>].&nbsp; Such idle tales form a silly song.<br>
In your home, my dear, I've been silenced too long<br>
Because, like a crap-shooter with the die,<br>
Madame won't give up her turn; but now my<br>
Chance has come.&nbsp; I applaud my son's great wisdom<br>
In opening his home to this holy person<br>
Who's been heaven-sent to meet your needs<br>
In turning from evil to God's holy deeds.<br>
For your soul's salvation, please pay attention:<br>
What he reprehends, merits reprehension.<br>
These visits, these balls, these conversations<br>
Are flawless signs of Satanic possession.<br>
In them you never hear the holy Credo--<br>
Just songs, chatter, gossip, malice, and innuendo.<br>
Often the neighbors get stabbed to the heart<br>
By vicious lies from the third or fourth part.<br>
So good people suffer real anxiety<br>
From the sad confusion spread at your party.<br>
A slew of slanders are spread along the way<br>
And, as a doctor told me the other day,<br>
This is truly the Tower of Babylon<br>
Because everyone babbles on and on;<br>
And, to tell a story that now comes to mind . . .<br>
Now look at him and how he laughs!&nbsp; [<i>Indicating Cleante</i>.]&nbsp; Go find<br>
Some snickering fools. They are just your kind!<br>
[<i>To Elmire</i>.]&nbsp; Adieu, my daughter.&nbsp; I'll say no more.<br>
But I don't intend to darken your door<br>
For a long, long time.&nbsp; You've fallen from grace.<br>
[<i>Slapping Flipote</i>.]&nbsp; Hurry up, there!&nbsp; Don't stand staring into space!<br>
Lord Almighty!&nbsp; I'll slap your silly face.<br>
Go on, you slut, go on.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE II<br>
Cleante, Dorine</b><br>
<br>
<b>Cleante.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not following;<br>
I'm sure there'd only be more quarrelling.<br>
How that old harridan . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, how I regret<br>
That she can't hear you use that epithet.<br>
She'd tell you at length what she thinks of your wit,<br>
And that she's not old enough to merit it.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; What a fuss she made about nearly nothing!<br>
And what a passion for Tartuffe, her darling!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Really, she's normal compared to her son,<br>
And if you could see him, you'd say, "Here's one<br>
Who's nuts!"&nbsp; During the war, he seemed quite sage,<br>
And in serving his prince, showed some courage,<br>
But now he's become an absolute fool<br>
Since he gave himself up to Tartuffe's rule.<br>
He calls him his brother and the love of his life--<br>
More dear than mother, daughter, son, or wife.<br>
He's the sole confidant of all his secrets<br>
And the sole director of all his projects.<br>
He caresses him, kisses him, and could not show a mistress<br>
More love and affection than he gives to this<br>
Leech.&nbsp; At dinner he gives him the highest place<br>
And watches with joy as he stuffs his face<br>
With cakes and tarts and often the best part<br>
Of a pig, and if he should happen to hiccup or fart,<br>
Says, "God be with you!"&nbsp; He's mad about him--<br>
His honey, his hero.&nbsp; He always quotes him<br>
And admires his deeds.&nbsp; His smallest acts are miracles<br>
And even his stupidest words are oracles.<br>
Tartuffe, who uses his dupe to make a buck,<br>
Knows a hundred wily ways to pluck this duck;<br>
He rakes off great sums with his biblical bull<br>
And demands the right to censor us all.<br>
His foolish footman has such presumption<br>
That even he dares to give us instruction.<br>
Madly preaching, he scatters with eyes afire<br>
Our ribbons, our rouge, and our best attire.<br>
Last night he ripped up with his own bare hands<br>
A kerchief left lying in <i>The Holy Lands</i>,<br>
Claiming our crime was truly gigantic<br>
In mixing what's holy with what's Satanic.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE III<br>
Elmire, Mariane, Damis, Cleante, Dorine</b><br>
<br>
<b>Elmire</b> [<i>to Cleante</i>].&nbsp; You should be glad you missed the dreadful chore<br>
Of attending her lecture beside the door--<br>
Here comes my spouse!&nbsp; Since he doesn't see me,<br>
I'm going upstairs to rest quietly.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Then I'll remain with no pleasure on my part<br>
To tell him hello and then quickly depart.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; Ask him about the marriage of Mariane.<br>
I think Tartuffe will oppose it if he can,<br>
For he sets up so many prerequisites,<br>
And you know what an interest I take in it.<br>
The heat that inflames my sister and Valere<br>
Has made his sweet sister so very dear<br>
To me that if . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shh, he's here.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE IV<br>
Orgon, Cleante, Dorine</b><br>
<br>
<b>Orgon.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, brother!<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; I'm glad you've returned before my departure.<br>
The countryside isn't quite blossoming yet.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Dorine . . . One second brother, please!&nbsp; Just let<br>
Me set my heart at ease and soothe my fear<br>
Concerning the things that have happened here. [<i>To Dorine</i>.]<br>
For these past two days, how have things gone on?<br>
What has happened?&nbsp; And how is everyone?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; The first day your wife had a bad fever<br>
And a headache that just wouldn't leave her.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; And Tartuffe?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tartuffe?&nbsp; He's in splendid shape,<br>
Fat and flabby, with red lips, and a shining face.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Poor fellow!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, your wife felt so sick<br>
And so feverish that she could only pick<br>
At her dinner and scarcely ate a bite.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; And Tartuffe?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He alone ate with all his might,<br>
And devoutly devoured a pair of pheasants<br>
And a leg of lamb in our lady's presence.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Poor fellow!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole night passed before she<br>
Could even close her eyes to fall asleep;<br>
Shivers and chills beset her in bed,<br>
And right up till dawn we watched her with dread.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; And Tartuffe?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drowsy from all that he'd consumed,<br>
He left the table, went straight to his room,<br>
And fell quickly into his nice, warm sack<br>
Where he slept all night flat on his back.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Poor fellow.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last your wife began heeding<br>
Our good advice that she needed bleeding,<br>
And she began to recover soon thereafter.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; And Tartuffe?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn't have been any better.<br>
To fortify himself against every ill<br>
And to regain the blood that Madam spilled,<br>
He drank at brunch four great glasses of wine.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Poor fellow!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of them are now quite fine;<br>
I'll now be going up to tell your wife<br>
Of your deep concern at this threat to her life.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE V<br>
Orgon, Cleante</b><br>
<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; She's making fun of you to your face, brother;<br>
And, though I don't intend to be a bother,<br>
I must frankly admit that there's some justice<br>
In what she says.&nbsp; What a crazy caprice<br>
You have for him!&nbsp; And how could he exert<br>
Such charm that you'll even let your wife be hurt?<br>
After taking this pauper into your heart,<br>
You go so far . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop there!&nbsp; Or we must part!<br>
You don't know the man to whom you refer.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Okay. Say I don't know him if you prefer,<br>
But then to know what sort of man he might be . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Brother, you'd be charmed if you could only see<br>
Him, and your glee would be . . . gargantuan!<br>
He's a man who . . . who . . . a man . . . well, a man!<br>
Learn from him a peacefulness most exquisite,<br>
That lets you drop your woes like . . . dried horseshit!<br>
Yes, I've been reborn because of his preaching:<br>
He teaches me that I shouldn't love anything,<br>
From every earthly passion he has freed my life;<br>
I'd watch my brother, mother, children, and wife<br>
Drop dead without caring so much as that! [<i>He snaps his fingers</i>.]<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; You've sure got humane sentiments down pat!<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Ah! If you'd seen him as I did at first,<br>
Your eyes would have feasted on him with a spiritual thirst!<br>
Each day he came to church smiling with sweet peace<br>
And threw himself down before me on both knees.<br>
He drew upon himself the eyes of everyone there<br>
By the holy fervor of his pious prayer.<br>
He sighed and wept with a most saintly passion<br>
And humbly kissed the earth in a fetching fashion;<br>
And when I was going, he rushed out front<br>
To bless me with water from the holy font.<br>
His servant (matching his master to a T)<br>
Then informed me of his identity--<br>
And his poverty.&nbsp; So I made a donation,<br>
But then he tried to return a portion.<br>
"It's too much," he said. "You're too generous;<br>
I don't merit your pity and kindness."<br>
And when I refused to take it back, he gave<br>
It in alms to the poor right there in the nave.<br>
Then God bade me take him into my home<br>
And now life is sweet as a honeycomb.<br>
He governs us all, and to protect my honor<br>
Bids my wife grant his godly rule upon her.<br>
He forewarns me of men who might give her the eye,<br>
And he really seems far more jealous than I!<br>
Why, you wouldn't believe his fear of Hell!<br>
He thinks himself damned for the least bagatelle.<br>
Such trifles suffice to scandalize him<br>
That he even accused himself of sin<br>
For having slain with a bit too much wrath<br>
A flea that just happened to cross his path.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; My goodness, brother!&nbsp; I think you're crazy!<br>
Are you mocking me with sheer lunacy?<br>
And how can you pretend that this pure rot . . . ?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Dear brother, your words reek of that free thought<br>
With which I find you more than a bit impeached,<br>
And, as ten times or more I have clearly preached,<br>
You will soon find yourself in a wicked bind.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Now this is the normal jargon of your kind.<br>
They want everyone to be as blind as they are.<br>
To be clear-sighted, is to be in error,<br>
And one who rejects their vain hypocrisy<br>
Has no respect for faith or sanctity.<br>
Go on, all your tart sermons scarcely smart;<br>
I know what I'm saying, and God sees my heart.<br>
I'm not a slave to your silly ceremony.<br>
There is false piety like false bravery;<br>
Just as one often sees, when honor calls us,<br>
That the bravest men never make the most fuss,<br>
So, too, the good Christians, whom one should follow,<br>
Are not those who find life so hard to swallow.<br>
What now? Will you not make any distinction<br>
Between hypocrisy and true devotion?<br>
Would you wish to use the same commonplace<br>
To describe both a mere mask and a true face?<br>
To equate artifice with sincerity<br>
Is to confound appearance and reality.<br>
To admire a shadow as much as you do<br>
Is to prefer counterfeit money to true.<br>
The majority of men are strangely made!<br>
And their true natures are rarely displayed.<br>
For them the bounds of reason are too small;<br>
In their shabby souls they love to lounge and sprawl.<br>
And very often they spoil a noble deed<br>
By their urge for excess and reckless speed.<br>
But all this, brother, is idle chatter.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Without doubt you are a renowned teacher;<br>
With all the world's knowledge in your coffer.<br>
You're the only oracle, the wisest sage,<br>
The enlightened one, the Cato of our age;<br>
And next to you, all other men are dumb.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Brother, I know I'm not the wisest one<br>
Nor the most learned man in Christendom<br>
But in moral matters my greatest coup<br>
Is to differentiate false from true.<br>
And since I know of no heroes about<br>
More to be praised than the truly devout<br>
And nothing at all with greater appeal<br>
Than the holy fervor of saintly zeal,<br>
So too nothing could be more odious<br>
Than the white-washed face of a zeal that's specious,<br>
Or these frank charlatans, seeking places,<br>
Whose false and sacrilegious double faces<br>
Exploit our love of God and make a game<br>
Of our reverence for Christ's holy name.<br>
These people who, with a shop-keeper's soul,<br>
Make cheap trinkets to trade on the Credo,<br>
And hope to purchase credit and favor<br>
Bought with sly winks and affected fervor;<br>
These people, I say, whose uncommon hurry<br>
On the path to Heaven leads through their treasury,<br>
Who, writhing and praying, demand a profit each day<br>
And call for a Retreat while pocketing their pay,<br>
Who know how to tally their zeal with their vices,--<br>
Faithless, vindictive, full of artifices--<br>
To ruin someone they'll conceal their resentment<br>
With a capacious cloak of Godly contentment.<br>
They are doubly dangerous in their vicious ire<br>
Because they destroy us with what we admire,<br>
And their piety, which gains them an accolade,<br>
Is a tool to slay us with a sacred blade.<br>
There are many men in this false disguise,<br>
But those with pure hearts are easy to recognize.<br>
Our age, my friend, has brought into plain sight<br>
Many glorious examples of what is right.<br>
Look at Ariston, or Periandre,<br>
Oronte, Alcidamus, or Clitandre;<br>
Their title is one that all agree to.<br>
They decline any fanfare for their virtue;<br>
They don't indulge in vain ostentation;<br>
Their humane faith finds form in moderation;<br>
They never censure all of our actions,<br>
For they sense the vain pride in such transactions.<br>
And, leaving boastful rhetoric to others,<br>
By their own actions they reprove their brothers.<br>
The appearance of evil is no concern of theirs;<br>
They cast the best light on others' affairs.<br>
They plot no intrigues; seek no one to fleece;<br>
Their only concern is to live at peace.<br>
They don't seek to cause any sinner chagrin;<br>
Their abhorrence is directed only at sin.<br>
And they don't take the side of God more extremely<br>
Than God himself--who could act supremely!<br>
These are my models, and these are their ways;<br>
Such examples are the ones that most merit praise.<br>
But your man, in truth, is not made from such steel.<br>
In good faith, perhaps, you praise his great zeal,<br>
But I think you're dazed by his meaningless<br>
Glitter.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear brother-in-law, are you finished?<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Your humble servant. [<i>He begins to leave</i>.]<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pardon me.&nbsp; One word, brother.<br>
Let's drop this discussion.&nbsp; You know that Valere<br>
Has your word that he'll be Mariane's spouse.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Yes.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you've announced this fact in your house.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; That is true.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then why postpone the event?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I don't know.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you intend to recant?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Perhaps.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How could you go back on your word?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I didn't say I would.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope no absurd<br>
Hitch could make you retract your own promise.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; We'll see.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you speak with such finesse?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Valere sent me to ask you this verbatim.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Praise God!<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what shall I report to him?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; What you please.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is essential<br>
To know your plans.&nbsp; What are they?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do all<br>
That God wishes.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stick to the point.&nbsp; I know<br>
Your promise.&nbsp; Will you keep it?&nbsp; Yes, or no?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Farewell.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fear his promise will be withdrawn,<br>
So I'd better report what's going on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>ACT II<br>
<br>
SCENE I<br>
Orgon, Mariane</b><br>
<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Mariane.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come here.&nbsp; We need to speak<br>
Privately.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father, what is it you seek?<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>looking in the closet</i>]. I'm seeing if anyone can overhear us.<br>
This is a perfect place for such a purpose.<br>
There now, it's okay.&nbsp; Mariane, I find<br>
You endowed with a heart that's sweet and kind<br>
And you have always been most dear to me.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; A father's love brings true felicity.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Well said, my child!&nbsp; And to earn it fully<br>
You should devote yourself to contenting me.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; That's how my devotion is put to the proof.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Now what do you think of our guest, Tartuffe?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Who me?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You.&nbsp; Think well before you reply.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Oh my!&nbsp; Tell me what to say . . . and I'll comply.<br>
<br>
[<i>Dorine enters quietly and hides herself behind Orgon without being seen.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; That's sensibly spoken.&nbsp; Now tell me, girl,<br>
That his merit shines like a gleaming pearl,<br>
That he warms your heart, and that you would rejoice<br>
To have him be your husband by my choice.<br>
Eh?<br>
<br>
[<i>Mariane recoils in dismay.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eh?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's that?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I in error?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Why?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom do you wish that I should now swear<br>
Touches my heart--and who would rejoice me<br>
If we joined, by your choice, in matrimony?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Tartuffe.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the question, father, I assure<br>
You!&nbsp; Why urge on me such an imposture?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; But, my dear, I wish it to be true,<br>
And it should be enough that I've chosen for you.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Father, would you . . .?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I intend, you see<br>
To unite in marriage Tartuffe and my family.<br>
He will be your husband.&nbsp; I do declare it!<br>
Since you have promised . . .<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE II<br>
Dorine, Orgon, Mariane</b><br>
<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>perceiving Dorine</i>].&nbsp; What do you stare at?<br>
You must be eaten up with curiosity<br>
To eavesdrop on my daughter and me.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; I don't know whether the rumor I hear<br>
Is sly conjecture or a wicked smear;<br>
But I've just heard word of this marriage,<br>
And I trust it is only verbiage.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Is the idea itself so very absurd?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; I wouldn't believe it, sir, if you gave your word!<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I will make you believe it by-and-by.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; You're going to tell us a bald-faced lie.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I am only saying what you will soon see.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Nonsense!<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I say, dear girl, will soon be.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Go on.&nbsp; Don't believe him!&nbsp; It's too bizarre!<br>
He's joking.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I say . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, you've gone too far,<br>
And no one believes you.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn you, you shrew . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Well, I believe you then; the worse for you.<br>
What?&nbsp; Monsieur, can you pose as one who's sage,<br>
Gravely stroking your bearded visage?<br>
And still be fool enough to wish . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear me!<br>
I have given you too much liberty,<br>
And it no longer gives me any pleasure.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Monsieur, please.&nbsp; Keep your anger within measure.<br>
Are you mocking us with your silly plot?<br>
Your daughter is no match for a bigot;<br>
He has other schemes to worry about.<br>
And what would you gain if she wed this lout?<br>
With your wealth, what benefit would it bring<br>
To pick a bum . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ssh!&nbsp; Say he has nothing;<br>
For that reason, you should revere him the more.<br>
He is a holy man and nobly poor.<br>
It raises him up to greater grandeur<br>
That he has renounced all wealth by his pure<br>
Detachment from the merely temporal<br>
And his powerful love for the Eternal.<br>
But my assistance may give him the means<br>
To restore his lands and remove his liens.<br>
He is a man of repute in the land of his birth,<br>
And, even as he is, he's a man of worth.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Yes, so he tells us, but his vanity<br>
Does not sit so well with true piety.<br>
A man pleased with a simple sanctity<br>
Needn't vaunt his name and his dignity,<br>
And the humility born of devotion<br>
Suffers beneath such blatant ambition.<br>
What good is his pride? . . . But perhaps I digress:<br>
Let's speak of the man--not his nobleness.<br>
Can you bestow, without feeling like a rat,<br>
A girl like this on a man like that?<br>
And shouldn't you think of propriety<br>
And foresee the end with anxiety?<br>
We know that some girls cannot remain chaste<br>
If their husband's tush is not to their taste,<br>
And that the best-laid plans for an honest life<br>
Are somewhat easier for the best-laid wife,<br>
And that many a man with a horned head<br>
Has driven his wife to another man's bed.<br>
It is entirely too much to ask<br>
That a wife be faithful to a flabby ass.<br>
And one who gives a girl to a man she hates<br>
Is guilty before God for all her mistakes.<br>
Consider the perils you expose yourself to.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; So you think I should learn how to live from you!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; You could do worse than follow my lead.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Dear daughter, do drop this maid's daffy creed;<br>
I know what's best for you in this affair.<br>
It's true I betrothed you to young Valere,<br>
But I hear he likes his dicing and drinking<br>
And even worse is inclined to free-thinking.<br>
I note with regret we don't see him at mass.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Must he be there the same moment you pass<br>
Like those who attend only to be seen?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Your advice isn't wanted.&nbsp; Don't intervene.<br>
Tartuffe is on the path to salvation,<br>
And that is a treasure past calculation.<br>
This wedding will bring blessings beyond measure,<br>
And be crowned with great sweetness and pleasure.<br>
Together you will live, thriving on love<br>
Like new-born babes, or a pair of turtledoves.<br>
You will never be found in angry debate<br>
For you will find all that you wish in this mate.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; She'll only make him a cuckold, I'm sure.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; What?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looks just like a caricature,<br>
And his fate, monsieur, will make him an ass<br>
No matter how much virtue your daughter has.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Don't interrupt me and remember your place<br>
And quit sticking your nose up in my face!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; I'm only trying, sir, to protect you.<br>
<br>
[<i>Hereafter she always interrupts him at the moment he begins speaking to his daughter.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; You're too kind, but do shut up--please do!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; If I didn't like you . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need liking.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; But I will like you, sir, despite your griping.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Oh?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your honor is dear and I'd be provoked<br>
To find you the butt of some smutty joke.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Can't you keep quiet?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all good conscience,<br>
It's a shame to foster such an alliance.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Shut up, you viper, with your brazen traits . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; What?&nbsp; You've been reborn, yet you give way to hate?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Yes, your twaddle has made me quite high-strung,<br>
And I now insist that you hold your tongue.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; But I'll think in silence nonetheless.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Think if you wish to, but strive for success<br>
At shutting your mouth . . . or beware.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to his daughter</i>]&nbsp; Let's see,<br>
I have weighed everything quite maturely.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>aside</i>]. I hate this silence.&nbsp; [<i>She falls quiet every time Orgon turns toward her.</i>]<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without being smug, I'll<br>
Say Tartuffe's face . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, he has a fine muzzle!<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Is so fine that even if you forgot<br>
His other traits . . .<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they're a sorry lot!<br>
<br>
[<i>Orgon turns toward Dorine and, with his arms folded, listens while staring in her face.</i>]<br>
<br>
If I were in her place, most assuredly<br>
No man would wed me with impunity,<br>
And I'd prove to him right after the wedding<br>
That a wife's vengeance lies in the bedding!<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>to Dorine</i>].&nbsp; So you refuse to obey me, is that true?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; What's your beef, sir?&nbsp; I'm not speaking to you.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Then what are you doing?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soliloquizing.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Very well. [<i>aside</i>]&nbsp; To give her a good chastising,<br>
I think she needs a taste of the back of my hand.<br>
<br>
[<i>He prepares to slap her, but each time Dorine sees him looking at her, she stands silent and erect.</i>]<br>
<br>
Child, you should approve of all I have planned . . .<br>
And have faith in the spouse . . . who's my designee.<br>
[<i>To Dorine</i>.]&nbsp; Speak to yourself!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've nothing to say to me.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Just one little word.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not in the mood.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Because I was ready!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What ineptitude!<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Now, daughter, let's see some obedience.<br>
Accept my choice with complete deference.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>running away</i>].&nbsp; I'd thumb my nose at such a silly spouse.<br>
<br>
[<i>Orgon tries to slap Dorine and misses.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Daughter, your maid is a pest and would arouse<br>
Vice in a saint--she's an absolute shrew!<br>
I'm so upset that I can't continue.<br>
Her taunts have nearly driven me to swear,<br>
And I need to calm down in the open air.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE III<br>
Dorine, Mariane</b><br>
<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Have you entirely lost your voice and heart?<br>
Why must I continue playing your part?<br>
To think you allow such a mad proposal<br>
Without voicing even a meek refusal!<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; How can I resist such a harsh patriarch?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; By any means!&nbsp; Don't be an easy mark!<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; But how?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell him you can't love on command,<br>
That you marry for yourself, not by demand,<br>
And since you are most concerned in these affairs<br>
You'll choose for yourself the sire of his heirs,<br>
And that, if Tartuffe is so charming to him,<br>
He can wed him himself--if that's his whim.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; A father, I'm sure, has absolute power;<br>
Before him I can only cringe and cower.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Use your head.&nbsp; Valere wants to tie the knot.<br>
Do you really love him, I ask--or not?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Your injustice to me has a mortal sting!<br>
Dorine, how can you ask me such a thing?<br>
Haven't I poured out my whole soul to you,<br>
And don't you know yet that my love is true?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; How do I know that your heart echoes your voice<br>
And that this love is truly your own choice?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Your doubts, Dorine, wrong me greatly;<br>
My real feelings are shown far too plainly.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; You love him then?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, with the strongest passion.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; And he seems to love you in the same fashion?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; I think so.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And both of you burn equally<br>
For this union in marriage?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; And about this other man, what's your intention?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; I'd die before I'd submit to coercion.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Fine!&nbsp; I hadn't thought of that recourse.<br>
Death would give you such a forcible divorce.<br>
What an ingenious remedy!&nbsp; Geez!<br>
I hate to hear such stupid ideas.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Good Heavens!&nbsp; What a rotten mood you're in!<br>
You have no pity for my pain, Dorine!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; I have no sympathy for foolishness<br>
And those who meet a crisis with such weakness.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; But what do you want me to do?&nbsp; I was born frail.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; A woman in love needs a heart of steel.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; But haven't I kept it free for my lover<br>
Whose task it is to win me from my father?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; What!&nbsp; If your father is a mad fanatic<br>
Whose love for Tartuffe is completely lunatic<br>
And who has blocked the match you are now bewailing,<br>
Is your lover to be damned for failing?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; But am I to display how deeply I'm bitten<br>
By rejecting Tartuffe like one who's love-smitten?<br>
Am I, because of Valere's strength and beauty,<br>
To renounce my modesty and duty?<br>
And would you have me show my heart to all . . . ?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; No, no, not at all.&nbsp; I'm wrong to forestall<br>
Your marriage to Tartuffe, and my defiance<br>
Is apparent in barring that alliance.<br>
What reason have I for my outrageous<br>
Attempt to stop something so advantageous?<br>
Tartuffe!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Isn't he something to behold?<br>
Surely Tartuffe is not made from such a mold,<br>
If rightly viewed, as to make a person laugh;<br>
'Twould be an honor to be his better half.<br>
The whole world already crowns him with glory;--<br>
Both in physique and character he's laudatory;<br>
He has red ears and a florid, flushing face<br>
With him for a mate you'd live in joyful grace.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Dear God!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What delight you will feel within<br>
To know that you're wed to a man like him.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Please stop talking, and show me the way<br>
To avoid this marriage.&nbsp; I will obey,<br>
You've said enough, and I'm ready to be led.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; A good daughter must obey her dad--<br>
Even if he wishes her to make love<br>
To an ape.&nbsp; What are you complaining of?<br>
You will proceed to his little villa<br>
Where you will get your absolute fill of<br>
Uncles and cousins to be entertained.<br>
Right away you'll move among the most urbane<br>
Of hicks.&nbsp; First you will make some overture<br>
To the wives of the judge and the tax assessor,<br>
Who will kindly seat you on a folding chair.<br>
During Carnival, you may hope to have there<br>
A ball with two bagpipes for an orchestra<br>
And maybe some puppets and a tame gorilla.<br>
But if your husband . . .<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; You're killing me.<br>
Please help me avoid this catastrophe.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; I am your servant.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Dorine, mercy . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; To punish you, I ought to leave things be.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; My dear girl!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I declared my love . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Tartuffe is your man; that's sure enough.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; You know that I've always trusted that you'd<br>
Help me . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. I'm sure you will be tartuffed.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; All right!&nbsp; Since my fate no longer moves you,<br>
Henceforth you may leave me alone and blue;<br>
From deep sorrow my heart will draw relief,<br>
And I know an absolute cure for my grief.<br>
<br>
[<i>She starts to leave</i>.]<br>
<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Whoa! I'm not really angry. Come back,--do.<br>
In spite of everything, I pity you.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; If I'm to be the one you crucify,<br>
You'll see, Dorine, how quickly I shall die.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Don't torture yourself.&nbsp; We can easily<br>
Block them. . . . But look!&nbsp; I think that's Valere I see.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE IV<br>
Valere, Mariane, Dorine</b><br>
<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; Gossip is singing a little ditty,<br>
My dear,--news to me and very pretty.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; What?<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That you will marry Tartuffe.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's true<br>
That my father has such a plan in view.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; Your father . . .<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has altered his inclination.<br>
Through him, all this has come to my attention.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Seriously?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, seriously.<br>
He wants this wedding--quite decidedly!<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; And how does your heart respond to this plan,<br>
Madam?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; I don't know.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your response is plain.<br>
You don't know?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you recommend?<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; I recommend that you accept this husband.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; You recommend that?<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really?<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do.<br>
A wonderful choice, well worth attending to.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Very well!&nbsp; That's advice, sir, that I accept.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; I doubt that taking it causes you regret.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; No more regret than giving it causes you.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; I gave it thinking pleasure would ensue.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; And I, I'll take it--simply to please you.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>moving upstage</i>].&nbsp; Let's see what comes of this hullabaloo.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; So that's your love for me?&nbsp; And did you lie<br>
When you . . .<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please, let's not speak of days gone by.<br>
You've told me quite plainly that I must embrace<br>
As my mate the man they've chosen for that place,<br>
And now I say that I promise to obey<br>
Since you so kindly advise me that way.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; Don't excuse yourself through circumlocution:<br>
You've already made your own resolution,<br>
And you've seized upon a frivolous excuse<br>
To justify this lamentable ruse.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Quite true and well said.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt, and your soul<br>
Never lost, for love of me, its self-control.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; You may as well think so.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; Yes, I may think so, but my broken heart<br>
Foresees you, too, suffering from Love's dart;<br>
I know to whom I'll take my heart and hand.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; No doubt, and the love that merit can command&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; Dear God, let's leave merit to one side.<br>
I haven't much of it, as you have signified,<br>
But I know where there's a woman, soft-eyed<br>
And open-hearted . . . and this double-cross<br>
May make her more inclined to recompense my loss.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; The loss isn't great; and your fickleness<br>
Will soon lead you to find a new mistress.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; I'll do my best--of that you may be sure!<br>
When one is forgotten, it's hard to endure,<br>
And so I, too, must struggle to forget.<br>
If I can't do it, I'll fake it . . . and yet<br>
I could never forgive my own servility<br>
If I kept loving one who abandoned me.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; What a noble, uplifting sentiment!<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; Quite so.&nbsp; Everyone should give it their assent.<br>
What?&nbsp; Do you think that I should perpetuate<br>
The flame of love that I have felt of late,<br>
And see you pass into another's arms<br>
Without letting my heart seek other charms?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; No, indeed.&nbsp; It's what I want, and I vow<br>
I wish the thing were to happen right now.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; You do?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's enough insults from you,<br>
Madam, and now I will bid you adieu.<br>
<br>
[<i>He starts to leave; each time he does so, he quickly comes back.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Very well.<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>coming back</i>]. At least remember that you<br>
Are the one who forced me down this avenue.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Yes.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that I am doing nothing more<br>
Than following the path you took before.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; So be it.<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>leaving</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I'm doing what you want.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Good.<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>returning again</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm leaving forever--not some short jaunt.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; The sooner the better.<br>
<br>
[<i>He begins to leave and, when he is near the door, he returns.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eh?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What?<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You called?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; No.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; Well then, I'll soon be abroad.<br>
Adieu, madam.&nbsp; [<i>He slowly starts to leave.</i>]<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adieu.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>to Mariane</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, perchance,<br>
You've lost your mind through extravagance,<br>
And I've only allowed you to go on<br>
Like this to see what folly you might spawn.<br>
Hey!&nbsp; Valere!<br>
<br>[<i>She grabs him by the arm and he makes a show of resistance.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; What do you want, Dorine?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Come here.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I'm too mad.&nbsp; Don't intervene.<br>
She wishes me to drain this bitter cup.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Stop.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, can't you see that my mind's made up?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Ah!<br>
<b>Mariane</b> [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; My presence pains him, I drive him away.<br>
I think it would be best if I didn't stay.<br>
<b>Dorine</b>&nbsp; [<i>She leaves Valere and runs after Mariane</i>].&nbsp; Now where are you going?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let go.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then return.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; No, no, Dorine.&nbsp; It's none of your concern.<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; I see that my presence causes her pain;<br>
It would be best if I freed her again.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>She leaves Mariane and runs to Valere</i>].<br>
Wait!&nbsp; May you both be damned if I want this mess!<br>
Come here you two and settle this fracas.<br>
<br>
[<i>She pulls them both together.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>to Dorine</i>].&nbsp; But what's your plan?<br>
<b>Mariane</b> [<i>to Dorine</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you wish to do?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; To patch things up a bit between you two.<br>
[<i>To Valere</i>].&nbsp; Are you out of your mind to fight in this way?<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; Did you hear her treat me like a popinjay?<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>to Mariane</i>].&nbsp; Are you mad to have gotten so enraged?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Did you see what happened?&nbsp; It can't be assuaged.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; You're both dunces.&nbsp; [<i>To Valere</i>] She wants nothing more<br>
Than to be the one woman you adore.<br>
[<i>To Mariane</i>]&nbsp; He loves you alone, and to make you his wife<br>
Is his only desire--I swear on my life!<br>
<b>Mariane</b> [<i>to Valere</i>].&nbsp; How, then, could you give me such bad advice?<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; And how could you demand it?&nbsp; Was that wise?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; You're both insane.&nbsp; Now give your hands to me.<br>
[<i>To Valere</i>]&nbsp; Come on.<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>giving his hand to Dorine</i>]. What for?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There.&nbsp; [<i>To Mariane</i>]&nbsp; Now yours, don't you see.<br>
<b>Mariane</b> [<i>giving her hand as well</i>].&nbsp; What's the point of all this?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; Quick!&nbsp; Come on!<br>
Your love for each other can't be withdrawn.<br>
<br>
[<i>Valere and Mariane hold hands for awhile without looking at each other.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>turning toward Mariane</i>].&nbsp; Don't react so painfully by the book.<br>
Try giving a fellow a civil look.<br>
<br>
[<i>Mariane turns her gaze on Valere and gives him a shy smile.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; All lovers are crazy!&nbsp; It's sad, but true.<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>to Mariane</i>].&nbsp; Am I not right to complain about you?<br>
And to tell the truth, weren't you rather unkind<br>
To delight in trying to unsettle my mind?<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; What about you?&nbsp; Aren't you the bigger ingrate . . . ?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Let's wait until later for this debate<br>
And try instead to stop this marriage.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Tell us, then, what we can use for leverage.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; We will wage warfare on every front.<br>
Your father is bluffing and playing a stunt.<br>
[<i>To Mariane</i>] But it might be better for you to seem<br>
To sweetly consent to his crazy scheme<br>
So that, whatever the future may bring,<br>
You can postpone and postpone this wedding.<br>
By gaining time, we gain our remedy.<br>
Sometimes you will feign a strange malady<br>
Whose sudden onset will bring some delay;<br>
Sometimes an ill-omen will cause you dismay:<br>
You saw a corpse and never felt queerer,<br>
Dreamt of muddy water, or broke a mirror.<br>
The point above all is that no one, I guess,<br>
Can force you to marry unless you say, "Yes."<br>
But our ship would sail in fairer weather<br>
If you were never seen talking together.<br>
[<i>To Valere</i>] Go, and without delay employ each friend<br>
To keep him on course toward what we intend.<br>
[<i>To Mariane</i>] We are going to seek help from his brother<br>
And we'll also recruit your step-mother.<br>
Farewell.<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>to Mariane</i>].&nbsp; Whatever we attempt to do,<br>
In truth, my greatest hope resides in you.<br>
<b>Mariane</b> [<i>to Valere</i>].&nbsp; Although I cannot answer for my father,<br>
I vow I'll never belong to another.<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; How happy you have made me!&nbsp; If they ever . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Fie! You young lovers prattle forever!<br>
Be off, I say.<br>
<b>Valere</b> [<i>going a step and then returning</i>].<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally . . .<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What blather!<br>
You go off that way, and you go the other.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>ACT III<br>
<br>
SCENE I<br>
Damis, Dorine<br>
<br>
Damis.</b>&nbsp; May a bolt of lightning now strike me dumb,<br>
May everybody treat me like a bum<br>
If either respect or force can hinder me<br>
From blowing my top at this calamity!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; For heaven's sake, control your displeasure.<br>
Your father has merely mentioned this measure.<br>
No one does everything he proposes.<br>
How something opens may not be how it closes.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; I need to stop this vulgar coxcomb's plot<br>
And in two little words tell him what's what.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Whoa now!&nbsp; Why don't you let your stepmother<br>
Manage him just as she does your father.<br>
Over Tartuffe she has her own little ways<br>
Of making him welcome all that she says,<br>
And perhaps she makes his heart go pitter-patter.<br>
Pray God it's true!&nbsp; That would be a fine matter.<br>
In fact she has summoned him for your sake<br>
In order to learn exactly what's at stake,<br>
To find out his feelings, and to let him know<br>
What really rotten results would flow<br>
From any pretensions he might have to marry.<br>
His valet says he's praying, and I should tarry--<br>
That he'll descend after he meditates.<br>
Be off then, I beg you, and let me wait.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; I demand to be here the whole time they meet.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; No. They must be alone.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't even speak.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; You're kidding yourself.&nbsp; You're so quick to anger,<br>
And that would surely put us all in danger.<br>
Go.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I'm going to watch--without getting cross.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; How tiresome you are!&nbsp; Here they come.&nbsp; Get lost!<br>
<br>
[<i>Damis hides himself in a closet.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE II<br>
Tartuffe, Laurent, Dorine<br>
<br>
Tartuffe</b> [<i>observing Dorine</i>].&nbsp; Laurent, lock up my hair shirt and my scourge,<br>
And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.<br>
If anyone comes calling, say I have gone<br>
To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; Such affectation and boastful behavior!<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; What do you wish?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To say . . .<br>
<b>Tartuffe</b> [<i>taking a handkerchief from his pocket</i>].&nbsp; Wait!&nbsp; By our Savior,<br>
Please!&nbsp; Before you speak take this handkerchief.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Why?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.<br>
Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,<br>
And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Then you are quite ready for temptation,<br>
And bare skin makes on you a big impression.<br>
I truly don't know why you feel such passion;<br>
I myself think lust is out of fashion,<br>
For I could see you nude from top to toe<br>
Without your pelt setting my cheeks aglow.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Put a little modesty in your discourse<br>
Or I must leave you instantly perforce.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; No, it is I who will leave you here in peace,<br>
And I will just say this before I cease:<br>
Madam is coming down to visit you<br>
And demands the favor of a rendezvous.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Oh yes!&nbsp; Most willingly!<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>to herself</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't he sweet!<br>
I'm even surer now that dog's in heat.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Will she soon come?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I can hear her.<br>
Yes, there.&nbsp; Now I will leave you two together.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE III<br>
Elmire, Tartuffe<br>
<br>
Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; May Heaven forever in its great bounty<br>
Grant you good health both in soul and body,<br>
And bless your days as much as he desires<br>
Who is the humblest of those your love inspires!<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; I'm much obliged for your pious wishes, but please,<br>
Let us be seated and put ourselves at ease.<br>
<b>Tartuffe</b> [<i>sitting down</i>].&nbsp; Have you quite recovered from your illness?<br>
<b>Elmire</b> [<i>sitting as well</i>].&nbsp; Yes, my headache quickly lost its sharpness.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; My prayers haven't enough value to buy<br>
Such grace from the Heavenly One on High,<br>
But most of my recent prayers have in essence<br>
Been mainly focused on your convalescence.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Your concern for me is somewhat disquieting.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; I dearly cherish your precious well-being,<br>
And to restore it I would have given my own.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Such Christian charity is overblown,<br>
But I am much obliged for all your care.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; I try to do as much for you as I dare.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; I wish to speak of some private business<br>
And am pleased there's no one to overhear us.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; I, too, am delighted, and <i>entre nous</i><br>
It's very sweet being one-on-one with you.<br>
For this also have I begged the Deity,<br>
But only now has he granted it to me.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; I myself want an encounter between us two<br>
Where your whole heart is opened through and through.<br>
<br>
[<i>Without exposing himself and in order to better hear the conversation, Damis opens the door of the closet in which he is hiding.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; In exchange for this unique blessing, I<br>
Desire only to reveal to you my<br>
Whole soul, and to swear that all my preaching<br>
About your guests--though perhaps over-reaching--<br>
Was not caused by any anger or hate<br>
But rather by a zeal that's passionate<br>
And pure . . .<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; I wholly understand and declare<br>
My belief that you seek only my welfare.<br>
<b>Tartuffe</b> [<i>pressing the tips of her fingers</i>].&nbsp; Yes, madam, it's true; my devotion is such . . .<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; You're hurting me.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passion pushes me too much.<br>
I never wanted to hurt you, I swear,<br>
And I would rather . . .<br>
<br>
[<i>He puts his hand on her knee.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is your hand there?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; I'm feeling your dress.&nbsp; Such fine dimity!<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Please let me go.&nbsp; You're tickling me.<br>
<br>
[<i>She pushes her chair back, and Tartuffe moves his forward.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Tartuffe</b> [<i>putting his hand on her lacy collar</i>].<br>
Dear Lord!&nbsp; But this workmanship is marvelous!<br>
Lacework nowadays is miraculous.<br>
I've never seen anything quite so fine.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; That's true.&nbsp; But let's speak of this concern of mine.<br>
I hear that my husband may be breaking his word<br>
And giving you his daughter.&nbsp; What have you heard?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; In truth, madam, some such words did transpire,<br>
But that is not the joy to which I aspire,<br>
And I see elsewhere those splendid attractions<br>
Which I seek to attain through all of my actions.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Then all your earthly love has been overthrown?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; My breast does not hold a heart made of stone.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; I'm sure that all your thoughts are on salvation,<br>
And nothing less holds any fascination.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; The love that attracts us to what's eternal<br>
Does not stop our love for the merely temporal.<br>
Our senses can be quite easily charmed<br>
By the perfect Earthly works that God has formed.<br>
His glory is mirrored in those like you,<br>
But in you yourself we see its rarest hue.<br>
He has molded your face with such sublime art<br>
That it surprises the eye and transports the heart,<br>
And I can't gaze upon you, you perfect creature,<br>
Without worshipping in you both God and nature,<br>
And sensing in my soul an ardent love<br>
For this, the most beautiful portrait by God above.<br>
At first I feared that my secret passion<br>
Might be a tricky trap laid by Satan,<br>
And I even resolved to flee from your eyes<br>
As if you were something to exorcise.<br>
But I finally learned, oh beauty most lovable,<br>
That my ardor for you could never be culpable,<br>
That I should even consider it right,<br>
And so I submit to my heart's delight.<br>
I confess that I'm playing an audacious part<br>
In presenting to you the gift of my heart,<br>
But I place all my faith in your kindness<br>
Like a beggar-man hindered by blindness.<br>
In you I seek peace, hope, and happiness;<br>
On you depends my torment or my bliss.<br>
And through you alone I will finally be<br>
Happy if you will, or sad if you please.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; That declaration is very urbane,<br>
But in a man of God it's a bit profane.<br>
You ought to protect your heart a bit better<br>
And reflect more deeply on such a matter.<br>
A saint like you whom we all hail . . .<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; I may be holy, but I'm nonetheless male,<br>
And when one sees your heavenly charms,<br>
It's time for reason to throw up its arms.<br>
I know such words from me may seem strange--though,<br>
Madam, after all, I am not an angel,<br>
And if you condemn the confession I'm making,<br>
Admit nonetheless that your beauty's breath-taking.<br>
From the first time I set eyes on your supreme<br>
Splendor, my heart became yours and you my queen.<br>
The ineffable sweetness of your divine gaze<br>
Shattered my stout heart and set it ablaze.<br>
That look conquered all--fasting, prayers, duty--<br>
And turned my vows into praise of your beauty.<br>
My eyes and my sighs have often shown my choice<br>
But to make it still clearer I now add my voice.<br>
If you should look down with a kindly eye<br>
Upon the base woes of a slave such as I<br>
And if your great kindness should happen to lead<br>
You to stoop down and grant what I need,<br>
I should always have for you, oh precious one,<br>
A love that beggars all comparison.<br>
With me your honor will never be damaged;<br>
No disgrace can attend an affair I have managed.<br>
All these gallants at court, for whom wives act absurd,<br>
Are reckless in their deeds and rash in their words.<br>
They endlessly brag about every success.<br>
Each favor they receive, they quickly confess,<br>
And their wagging tongues, on which you rely,<br>
Dishonor the shrine before which they lie.<br>
But men like me burn with a discreet fever,<br>
And we keep your sweet secrets safe forever.<br>
The concern we have for our good reputation<br>
Will also preserve you in your own station;<br>
In us you will find, if you wish it, my dear,<br>
Love without scandal, pleasure without fear.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; I have heard your words, and your rhetoric<br>
Leaves your point clear--though you lay it on thick.<br>
Aren't you afraid that I could be in the mood<br>
To tell my husband of your solicitude,<br>
And that a sudden knowledge of that sort<br>
Might set back your hopes of his lasting support?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; I know that you are only too gracious<br>
And that you will forgive my audacious<br>
Deeds since they spring from a human failing<br>
In that passionate love that you are bewailing,<br>
And that you will reflect when you view things afresh<br>
That I am not blind, and a man's only flesh.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Others might take things differently, I suppose,<br>
But discretion prevails, and I won't expose<br>
This matter to my spouse.&nbsp; In return, it's true,<br>
I do want one little favor from you:<br>
To push forward without any sly snare<br>
The wedding of Mariane and Valere,<br>
To renounce on your own the unjust power<br>
That would enrich you with another's dower,<br>
And . . .<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE IV<br>
Elmire, Damis, Tartuffe<br>
<br>
Damis</b> [<i>coming out of the closet in which he was hiding</i>].<br>
No, madam, no.&nbsp; All this must be exposed.<br>
By hiding here I've heard all he proposed,<br>
And God in His goodness has guided me<br>
To confound this noisome bastard's treachery,<br>
To discover a way to take my vengeance<br>
For his hypocrisy and insolence,<br>
To wake up my father, and to justly screw<br>
This scumbag who wants to make love to you.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; No, Damis.&nbsp; It's enough if he has striven<br>
To reform and merit the pardon I've given.<br>
Don't make me retract what I have avowed.<br>
I don't choose to discuss scandal out loud:<br>
A woman laughs at these masculine foibles,<br>
And never plagues her mate with paltry troubles.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; You have your own reasons for acting so,<br>
And I have reasons for my <i>quid-pro-quo.</i><br>
The very thought of sparing him is a joke,<br>
And the insolent pride of this base bloke<br>
Has triumphed too often over my just wrath,<br>
And has sown too much trouble along my path.<br>
For too long that liar has ruled my old man<br>
Blocking both my love and that of Mariane.<br>
His perfidy must be brought to light of day,<br>
And for that God gives us a ready way.<br>
For this occasion I thank the good Lord;<br>
It is far too lucky to be ignored.<br>
The only way to deserve to lose it<br>
Is to have it in hand and not to use it.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; But Damis . . .<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, please, my mind is made up.<br>
It is time to rejoice and fill up the cup,<br>
And you're trying in vain to obligate me<br>
To give up the pleasure of my victory.<br>
I'm going to expose this affair without delay;<br>
This is just the thing that will make my day.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE V<br>
Orgon, Damis, Tartuffe, Elmire<br>
<br>
Damis.</b>&nbsp; Father, it may surprise . . . and amuse you greatly . . .<br>
To hear the news of what's gone on lately.<br>
You're being well paid for all your caresses<br>
By your friend's response to those tendernesses.<br>
His great love for you has shown its hold<br>
Through his eagerness to make you a cuckold.<br>
And I heard him here confess to your bride<br>
A love that has made him heart-sick and dove-eyed.<br>
At all costs she wants to remain discreet<br>
And preserve his secret--because she's sweet--<br>
But I cannot bear the man's impudence.<br>
Besides, my silence would cause you offense.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Yes, I would never disturb my husband's rest<br>
By reporting the words of silly pest.<br>
My honor does not depend on such a thing<br>
Since I'm well able to resist flattering.<br>
You wouldn't have spoken out against my view<br>
If I had any power over you.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE VI<br>
Orgon, Damis, Tartuffe<br>
<br>
Orgon.</b> What do I hear?&nbsp; Good God!&nbsp; Is it credible?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Yes, brother, I'm wicked and culpable,<br>
A sorry sinner, full of iniquity,<br>
As great a wretch as there ever could be.<br>
My entire life has been soiled with evil;<br>
It's nothing but a mass of sinful upheaval.<br>
And I see that God has, for my punishment,<br>
Chosen to mortify me with this event.<br>
Let them connect any crime with my name;<br>
I waive all defense and take all the blame.<br>
Believe what they tell you, stoke up your wrath,<br>
And drive me like a felon from your path.<br>
The shame that I bear cannot be too great,<br>
For I know I deserve a much worse fate.<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>to his son</i>].&nbsp; Traitor! Do you dare, by your duplicity,<br>
To taint both his virtue and purity?<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Can the false meekness of this hypocrite<br>
Cause you to belie . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shut up, you&nbsp; misfit.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Oh, let him go on.&nbsp; You are wrong to scold,<br>
And you'd be wise to believe the story he's told.<br>
In light of his claims, why should you favor me?<br>
What do you know of my culpability?<br>
Why put your faith in my exterior?<br>
Why should you think that I'm superior?<br>
No, no, appearances are fooling you,<br>
I am the kind of man you should eschew.<br>
The whole world thinks that I have earned God's blessing,<br>
But the plain truth is . . . that I'm worth nothing.<br>
<br>
[<i>Addressing Damis</i>]<br>
<br>
Yes, my dear son, speak.&nbsp; And don't merely chide.<br>
Accuse me of treason, theft, and homicide.<br>
Call me every foul name you can recall.<br>
I deny nothing.&nbsp; I merit it all.<br>
And I beg on my knees to bear this chagrin<br>
As the shameful result of my life of sin.<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>To Tartuffe</i>].&nbsp; That's too much, brother.&nbsp; [<i>To his son</i>]&nbsp; Why can't you let go,<br>
Scoundrel?<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Have his words seduced you so . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b> Keep quiet, you bum!&nbsp; [<i>To Tartuffe</i>].&nbsp; Brother, please arise.<br>
[<i>To his son</i>].&nbsp; Shame!<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence!<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn!&nbsp; Do you surmise . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; If you say one word, I will break your arm.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; In the name of God, brother, do no harm.<br>
I would rather face a ravening beast<br>
Than that your dear son should be harmed in the least.<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>to his son</i>].&nbsp; Ingrate!<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave him in peace.&nbsp; On my two knees<br>
I beg you to give him your grace . . .<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>throwing himself to his knees and embracing Tartuffe</i>].&nbsp; Don't!&nbsp; Please!<br>
[<i>To his son</i>]&nbsp; Wretch, see his goodness.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shhh!<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cease, I say.<br>
I'm aware of your motive in this foray:<br>
You all hate him, and now I see how my wife,<br>
Children, and maid conspire against his life.<br>
You impudently try every trick you can<br>
To alienate me from this holy man,<br>
But the harder you try to drive him away,<br>
The harder I'll try to get him to stay.<br>
And I'll hasten his marriage to Mariane<br>
To demolish the pride of this whole clan.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; So you will force her to marry this fellow?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Yes, this very night, to see you bellow.<br>
I defy you all, and stand here to say<br>
I am the master and you must obey.<br>
Come now.&nbsp; Retract your words, oh foul pollution!<br>
Throw yourself down and demand absolution.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; Who, me?&nbsp; Of that villain, by whose pretense . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; So you refuse, you scum, and your impertinence<br>
Persists? [<i>To Tartuffe</i>]&nbsp; A stick!&nbsp; A staff!&nbsp; Don't hold me back.<br>
[<i>To his son</i>] Get out of my house and don't even pack,<br>
And never again let me see your face.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; Yes, I will go, but . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly!&nbsp; Leave this place.<br>
I am cutting you off and what is worse<br>
I am leaving you with my heart-felt curse.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE VII<br>
Orgon, Tartuffe<br>
<br>
Orgon.</b>&nbsp; To offend in that way a saintly man!<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Heavenly Lord pardon him if you can.<br>
[<i>To Orgon.</i>]&nbsp; If you only knew with what pain<br>
I see them trying to blacken my name. . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Alas!<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mere thought of this ingratitude<br>
Makes me suffer from a torture so crude . . .<br>
The horror I feel . . . My soul longs to cry . . .<br>
I can't even speak, and I'm sure I will die.<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>He runs weeping to the door through which he had chased his son.</i>]<br>
Villain!&nbsp; How I regret that I held my hand<br>
And that I did not crush you where you stand.<br>
[<i>To Tartuffe.</i>]&nbsp; Calm yourself, brother and try not to fret.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Let's stop these squabbles that end in regret.<br>
The great friction I have caused makes me grieve,<br>
And I believe, brother, that I should leave.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Surely you jest?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They hate me and I see<br>
That they want you to doubt my integrity.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Who cares!&nbsp; Do you think I'll listen to them?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; No doubt they'll continue their stratagem;<br>
And the same tales that you reject today<br>
You may find credible some other day.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; No, brother, never.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, brother, a man's mate<br>
Can easily make her spouse speculate.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; No, no.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me leave here at once and so<br>
Escape the threat of another low blow.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; No, please remain.&nbsp; I can't live without you.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; I suppose I will suffer if I do.<br>
Still, if you wish . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh!<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right! It's a pact.<br>
But in future I know how I must act.<br>
Honor is tender, and friendship engages<br>
Me to prevent gossip--however outrageous.<br>
I'll avoid your wife and you will not see me . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; No, in spite of everyone, you and she<br>
Must often meet.&nbsp; I love to make a stir,<br>
So day and night let them see you with her.<br>
No, that's not enough, but this will make them stew:<br>
I don't want to have any heir but you,<br>
And I'm going to legally designate<br>
You as the owner of my whole estate.<br>
A frank and true friend, whom I take as my son,<br>
Is dearer to me than my wife or children.<br>
Will you accept the offer I am making?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; May God's will be done in this undertaking!<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Poor man!&nbsp; Let's quickly put it all in writing,<br>
And let their envy choke on its own spiting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>ACT IV<br>
SCENE I<br>
Cleante, Tartuffe<br>
<br>
Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Yes, the whole town is talking about it,<br>
And they don't think it does you much credit.<br>
And I've sought you out, sir, just for the sake<br>
Of telling you bluntly what I think's at stake.<br>
I'm not going to dredge up the whole dispute;<br>
The fact is Damis is in disrepute.<br>
Supposing that he did act like a fool<br>
And that you are unfairly being called cruel,<br>
Shouldn't a Christian pardon the offense<br>
And purge his soul of desire for vengeance?<br>
And should you permit him, for this one goof,<br>
To be driven away from his father's roof?<br>
I'll tell you again, and I'll be bold:<br>
You are scandalizing both young and old.<br>
If you take my advice, you will seek a truce<br>
And not be a party to this boy's abuse.<br>
Make an offering to God of your acrimony,<br>
And restore the son to his patrimony.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; As for myself, I seek that solace:<br>
I do not have for him the slightest malice;<br>
I wholly forgive him of any blame,<br>
And long to restore him to his good name.<br>
But in the service of God I can't permit<br>
It, for if he remains I shall have to quit<br>
This house.&nbsp; No prior offense holds a candle<br>
To his.&nbsp; Our meeting would cause a huge scandal.<br>
Lord only knows what people would assume!<br>
They would impute it to cunning, I presume,<br>
And say that my guilt has made me pretend<br>
To excuse him of any intent to offend,<br>
And that I fear him and wish to placate him<br>
As a crafty move in my plan to checkmate him.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; I think you are making up excuses,<br>
And your arguments, monsieur, seem like ruses.<br>
Must you assume the role of the Deity?<br>
Does He need us to punish the guilty?<br>
Leave it to Him to take care of vengeance;<br>
He bids us to forgive every offense<br>
And not to consider human judgments<br>
When we follow God's sovereign commandments.<br>
What?&nbsp; Should the petty fear of what some may say<br>
Prevent you from doing this good deed today?<br>
No, let us always follow God's commands,<br>
And leave all other matters in His hands.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; I've told you already that I forgive<br>
Him, and that, sir, is God's directive.<br>
But after such scandal and vituperation<br>
God doesn't demand our cohabitation.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; And does He demand that you lend your hand<br>
To the pure caprice of the father's command<br>
And accept the gift of his whole estate,<br>
Which you cannot justly appropriate?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Those who know me will not believe that I'd<br>
Do anything selfish or unjustified.<br>
I hold worldly goods in quite low esteem.<br>
I can't be dazzled by their phony gleam.<br>
And if in the end I decide to take<br>
The gift that the father wishes to make,<br>
It is only, I swear, because I fear<br>
That it could be left to a false profiteer,<br>
Or that it could be shared by those who would<br>
Use it to do evil rather than good,<br>
And who would not use it, as I'm sure I can,<br>
For the glory of God and one's fellow man.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Oh, sir!&nbsp; Don't put on that scrupulous air<br>
While your actions injure a rightful heir.<br>
Don't feel uneasy or risk your good health<br>
By fretting about the perils of his wealth.<br>
It is better spent on a young man's whim<br>
Than that you be accused of defrauding him.<br>
I only wonder why you aren't ashamed<br>
By this proposal in which you are named.<br>
In true religion is there some dictum<br>
That says it's okay to make an heir your victim?<br>
And if God has put some obstacle in place<br>
Against you and Damis sharing the same space,<br>
Wouldn't you prefer to be more discrete<br>
And leave this house in a noble retreat<br>
Than to sit and see the son of the house<br>
Thrust from his home like a beggarly louse.<br>
Believe me, it would prove your probity,<br>
Monsieur, . . .<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now, Monsieur, half past three:<br>
Certain religious rites demand my presence,<br>
And you must excuse me for my absence. [<i>He leaves.</i>]<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Ah!<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE II<br>
Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Cleante<br>
<br>
Dorine</b> [<i>to Cleante</i>].&nbsp; Please, sir, help us help her, for pity's sake.<br>
Her suffering is such that her heart may break,<br>
And the pact her father made this evening<br>
Is the cause of all this awful grieving.<br>
Here he comes.&nbsp; Let's join forces, I beg you,<br>
And try through skill or cunning to undo<br>
The vicious scheme that's left us all so troubled.<br>
<br>
<b>Scene III<br>
Orgon, Elmire, Mariane, Cleante, Dorine<br>
<br>
Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; I'm pleased to see you all assembled.<br>
[<i>To Mariane</i>]&nbsp; This contract here should make you very gay;<br>
I'm sure you know what I'm about to say.<br>
<b>Mariane</b> [<i>kneeling</i>].&nbsp; In the name of God, who knows how I hurt,<br>
And of everything which might move your heart,<br>
Forgo, for now, the rights of paternity<br>
And release me from my vow of docility.<br>
Do not reduce me by some brutal rule<br>
To asking God why you've grown so cruel.<br>
And this life, alas, that you gave to me--<br>
Do not make it a life of misery.<br>
If, contrary to all my sweet hopes of<br>
Joy, you forbid me to wed the man I love,<br>
Hear me at least--on my knees I implore<br>
You not to give me to a man I abhor,<br>
And don't push me past the point of despair<br>
By using your full force in this affair.<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>to himself, sensing himself weakening</i>].<br>
Be firm.&nbsp; This is no time for humanity!<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Your fondness for him doesn't bother me.<br>
Indulge it, and if it's not enough to consign<br>
Your whole estate to him--then give him mine!<br>
I freely consent and will sign on demand,<br>
But please, please, do not offer him my hand,<br>
And allow me to live in a convent where I<br>
May count the sad days till God lets me die.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Young girls always play such religious pranks<br>
When their fathers hobble their lusty flanks!<br>
Get up!&nbsp; The harder you have to work to bear it,<br>
The greater the virtue and the merit.<br>
Let this marriage mortify your senses<br>
And quit bothering me with your meek defenses.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; But . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep quiet, and stay out of this matter.<br>
I completely forbid you to add to the chatter.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; If you will allow me to offer some advice . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Brother, your advice is worth any price:<br>
It is thoughtful and I truly respect it,<br>
But I hope you don't mind if I reject it.<br>
<b>Elmire</b> [<i>to her husband</i>].&nbsp; What can I think about what you're saying<br>
Except that your blindness is quite dismaying!<br>
You must be besotted and led astray<br>
To refuse to believe what has happened today.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; My dear, I only call 'em as I see 'em.<br>
You favor my son, that worthless young bum,<br>
And I think that you are afraid to condemn<br>
His dirty trick on this most saintly of men.<br>
You are, in fact, too calm to be believed;<br>
You ought to have seemed a bit more aggrieved.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; When a love-sick man makes a foolish mistake<br>
Must we take up arms as if honor's at stake?<br>
And should we always respond to small slips<br>
With fire in our eyes and abuse on our lips?<br>
For myself, I laugh at these signs of lust;<br>
It doesn't please me at all to grow nonplussed.<br>
I seek wisdom tempered with charity,<br>
And I'm not one of those prudes whose asperity<br>
Is such that they fight for virtue tooth and nail,<br>
And scratch a man's eyes out for being male.<br>
Heaven preserve me from that kind of virtue!<br>
I am an honest wife, but not a shrew,<br>
And I believe that a calm, icy glance<br>
Is quite enough to rebuff an advance.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I know what I know and I won't change my mind.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; I'm again amazed that you could be so blind.<br>
But would you keep that incredulity<br>
If I made you see that we have spoken truly?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; See?<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fantasy!<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if I found a way<br>
To make you see it all in light of day?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Fairy tales!<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a man!&nbsp; At least reply.<br>
I don't ask you to believe me, but I<br>
Do wonder what you will say of your good man<br>
If I bring you to a place where you can<br>
Clearly see and hear these things?&nbsp; What then?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; In that case I would say . . . nothing again,<br>
For it cannot be.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've been blind too long,<br>
And in calling me a liar, you're wrong!<br>
So for your pleasure, but with modesty,<br>
I'll make you witness my veracity.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; I take you at your word.&nbsp; Now let's see<br>
How in the world you will prove this to me.<br>
<b>Elmire</b> [<i>to Dorine</i>].&nbsp; Bid him come to me.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>to Elmire</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a crafty one<br>
And perhaps he won't easily be undone.<br>
<b>Elmire</b> [<i>to Dorine</i>].&nbsp; No, we're easily duped by our affection,<br>
And vanity aids in our misdirection.<br>
<br>
[<i>Speaking to Cleante and Mariane</i>]<br>
<br>
Send him down here to me.&nbsp; And you can go.<br>

<br>
<b>SCENE IV<br>
Elmire, Orgon<br>
<br>
Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Bring the table here, and then crouch down low.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Why?<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiding you well is to be desired.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Why under the table?<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just do what's required!<br>
I've made my plans and we'll see how they fare!<br>
Get under the table, and when you're down there,<br>
Don't let him see you and try not to grunt.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I really think I'm far too tolerant,<br>
But I'll stay through the end of your stratagem.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; You won't, I'm sure, have a thing to condemn.<br>
<br>
[<i>To her husband, who is now under the table.</i>]<br>
<br>
Mind you, I'm going to have strange things to say<br>
And you must not be shocked in any way.<br>
Whatever I may say, you must allow;<br>
I only wish to convince you, anyhow.<br>
I'm going to use sex, since I'm reduced to it,<br>
To strip off the cloak of this hypocrite;<br>
I'll stoke up the fires of his insolent heart<br>
And give a free field to this base upstart.<br>
For your sake, and to deepen his disrepute,<br>
I'm going to pretend to welcome his suit.<br>
I'll quit just as soon as you've heard enough.<br>
Things needn't go farther than you wish, my love.<br>
And you must stop them from becoming bizarre<br>
When you think his mad love has gone too far.<br>
Spare your wife and don't leave me in his hands<br>
Longer than reaching your conviction demands.<br>
This is your concern and you are in command.<br>
Here he comes.&nbsp; Keep still! Keep down! Understand?<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE V<br>
Tartuffe, Elmire, Orgon (<i>under the table</i>)<br>
<br>
Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; You wish to speak with me in here, I'm told.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Yes. I now have some secrets to unfold,<br>
But shut the door before I say a word<br>
And look around--we mustn't be overheard.<br>
<br>
[<i>Tartuffe closes the door and returns.</i>]<br>
<br>
I don't want another fracas to ensue<br>
Like the one that overtook us hitherto.<br>
Never before have I been so dismayed!<br>
Damis startled me and made me afraid<br>
For you.&nbsp; You must have seen that I did my best<br>
To disrupt his plan and soothe his unrest.<br>
It is true that I was so filled with shame<br>
That I never thought of denying his claim,<br>
But by the grace of God, I'm nearly sure<br>
All is for the best and we're now more secure.<br>
The prestige of your name has dispelled the storm,<br>
And my husband will never suspect you of harm.<br>
Defying those with rumors to foment,<br>
He wants us together at every moment.<br>
And that is why without blame I can<br>
Be alone with you although you're a man,<br>
And that allows me to open my heart<br>
Willingly to the sweet thoughts you impart.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; I find it odd that you have kind words to say;<br>
Earlier you treated me in a different way.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; If you're angry about that rebuff,<br>
You know nothing about a woman's love!<br>
And how little you know about our intent<br>
If you think a weak defense is really meant!<br>
At such times our modesty must contend<br>
With the tender feelings that triumph in the end.<br>
No matter how strongly you make love's claim,<br>
In embracing it we always feel some shame.<br>
We resist at first, but in our faces<br>
It's clear that we'll soon yield to your embraces.<br>
Our words and our wishes are often opposed:<br>
A refusal may mean we accept what's proposed.<br>
No doubt I am making too free a confession<br>
And I may be committing an indiscretion,<br>
But since my attempt at silence has gone awry,<br>
Ask yourself why I sought to pacify<br>
Damis, and what made me listen so long<br>
And so kindly to your sweet love song?<br>
Would I have reacted as you saw me do<br>
If the offer of your heart didn't please me too?<br>
And what should you be able to conclude<br>
From my fervent desire to preclude<br>
The marriage that has been announced just now?<br>
Isn't it that I'd hate for a wedding vow<br>
To come between us, and that I care for you<br>
And want nothing at all to split us in two?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; There is no pleasure in Heaven above<br>
Sweeter than such words from the lips I love;<br>
Their honeyed sound flows richly through my senses<br>
With the sweetness of the purest essences.<br>
The pleasure of pleasing you is my one goal,<br>
And my heart finds happiness in that role,<br>
But that heart also takes the slight liberty<br>
Of daring to doubt this felicity.<br>
Perhaps these sweet words are a decorous ruse<br>
Designed to disrupt my hymeneal news;<br>
And, if I may speak quite freely with you,<br>
I won't believe that all you say is true<br>
Until I'm assured that you couldn't lie<br>
By a few of those favors for which I sigh.<br>
Such favors would make me your devotee<br>
And a true believer in your fondness for me.<br>
<b>Elmire</b> [<i>she coughs to warn her husband</i>].<br>
Do you demand to push on with such great speed,<br>
And drain my heart dry by your burning need?<br>
I risk my life in proclaiming my love,<br>
And for you even that is not enough!<br>
Can't you be satisfied with what I say?<br>
Must you force me into going all the way?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; The less one merits, the more one desires.<br>
Mere words will never quench our raging fires.<br>
A promised gift is often suspected;<br>
We rarely believe it, until we inspect it.<br>
I, who so little merit your favors,<br>
Doubt the happy outcome of my labors.<br>
And I will not believe a thing, my dear,<br>
Until you ease my pain to prove you're sincere.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Good God, your love is too oppressive;<br>
It troubles my soul and becomes obsessive!<br>
What a crazy power it has on the heart!<br>
With what fierce passion it tears me apart!<br>
What!&nbsp; Is there no way to stave off your desire?<br>
Won't you give me a moment to respire?<br>
Do you think it is fair to be so firm,<br>
To demand everything and watch me squirm,<br>
To take what you want, pushing and pressing,<br>
And abusing my weakness in acquiescing?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; If you look on me with a kindly heart,<br>
Then prove how you feel by playing your part.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; But how can I give you the things you seek<br>
Without offending that God of whom you speak?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; If it's only God that opposes my desire,<br>
I'll think up a way to make him conspire,<br>
And that need not restrain your heart, my dear.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; But the decrees of God scare me to tears.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; I can dispel your foolish fears, madame,<br>
For I know the art of quashing each qualm.<br>
Though God forbids certain gratifications,<br>
With him one can reach one's accommodations.<br>
It is a science to stretch out the strings<br>
Of conscience in the service of diverse things<br>
And to rectify an evil action<br>
With the purity of our intention.<br>
Regarding these secrets, I shall instruct you;<br>
You need only allow me to conduct you.<br>
Satisfy my desire and have no fear;<br>
I'll assume the sin and leave your soul clear.<br>
<br>
[<i>Elmire coughs more loudly.</i>]<br>
<br>
That's quite a cough, madame.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it's a torment.<br>
<b>Tartuffe</b> [<i>offering Elmire a piece of candy</i>].<br>
Would it help to have a licorice or mint?<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; It's an obstinate illness, and I see<br>
That all the mints in the world won't help me<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; It's certainly troublesome.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's for sure!<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Your scruples at least are easy to cure:<br>
You can be sure that I will keep things quiet--<br>
A deed is evil only if men spy it.<br>
The noise of scandal is the source of offense;<br>
There is no sin if one sins in silence.<br>
<b>Elmire</b> [<i>after having coughed and knocked on the table</i>].<br>
At last I see I'm forced to go astray,<br>
And I must consent to let you have your way,<br>
And that I cannot hope that short of the deed<br>
You will be content and willing to concede.<br>
It is very hard to be forced to do it,<br>
And in spite of myself to stoop down to it;<br>
But since you persist in making me obey,<br>
Since you refuse to believe what I say,<br>
And since you demand more convincing proof,<br>
I'll have to give in and quit acting aloof.<br>
If this action causes anyone grief,<br>
The blame be on him who refused all relief.<br>
The fault most certainly is none of mine.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Yes, madame, I agree and that is fine . . .<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Peek out of the door and see, I beg you,<br>
If my spouse is spying on our rendezvous.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Why do you care what he sees or where he goes?<br>
He's a man who loves to be led by the nose.<br>
Our trysts are something he's proud of achieving,<br>
And he'd watch us go to it without believing.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; No matter.&nbsp; Please, go have a look outside;<br>
I'd hate to think he's found some place to hide.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE VI<br>
Orgon, Elmire<br>
<br>
Orgon</b> [<i>coming out from under the table</i>].&nbsp; There, I swear, is an abominable man!<br>
I can't get over it.&nbsp; What is his plan?<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; How now?&nbsp; Come out so soon?&nbsp; Were you having fun?<br>
Get back down there.&nbsp; We've only just begun.<br>
Wait till the end to be completely sure,<br>
And don't put your faith in mere conjecture.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; No man more evil has been spawned in Hell.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Dear Lord!&nbsp; Don't believe the lies people tell.<br>
Be wholly convinced before you concede:<br>
Cautious men shun the slips that come with speed.<br>
<br>
[<i>She pushes her husband behind her.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE VII<br>
Tartuffe, Elmire, Orgon<br>
<br>
Tartuffe</b> [<i>without seeing Orgon</i>].&nbsp; All things conspire, madame, for my contentment:<br>
I've closely examined the whole apartment;<br>
No one is around, and my heart's delight. . .<br>
<br>
[<i>Just as Tartuffe comes forward with open arms to embrace Elmire, she steps back and Tartuffe sees Orgon.</i>]<br>
<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>stopping him</i>].&nbsp; Hold on!&nbsp; Your desires are too quick to ignite,<br>
And you mustn't let passion be overdone.<br>
Oh!&nbsp; Man of blessings, you wished to give me one!<br>
How temptation has taken over your life!<br>
You'd marry my daughter, and covet my wife!<br>
I've doubted your word for quite a long while,<br>
And I've always believed you'd change your style;<br>
But this is enough to give me my proof:<br>
I am fed up and want no more, Tartuffe.<br>
<b>Elmire</b> [<i>to Tartuffe</i>].&nbsp; It was against my will to act this way,<br>
But I was forced into the part I play.<br>
<b>Tartuffe</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>].&nbsp; What?&nbsp; You think . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, please, let's have no to-do.<br>
Get out of my home without more ado.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; My intent . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is no time for sly repartee;<br>
You must leave my house immediately.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; You must leave, you who speak as the master:<br>
The house is mine, and you'd better learn fast or<br>
I shall show you that it's senseless to pick<br>
A fight with me using this cowardly trick,<br>
That it will get you nowhere to insult me,<br>
And that I will punish your falsity,<br>
Avenge God's wounds, and make you grieve<br>
For talking here about forcing me to leave.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE VIII<br>
Elmire, Orgon<br>
<br>
Elmire.</b>&nbsp; What is he saying and what is he after?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I'm ashamed to say this is no time for laughter.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; Why?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see my error by what he said;<br>
I gave him my lands.&nbsp; What was wrong with my head?<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; You gave him . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes and they can't be restored,<br>
But there's something else that troubles me more.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; What is that?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll tell you soon, but first there's<br>
A certain box I want to find upstairs.<br>
<br>
<b>ACT V<br>
SCENE I<br>
Orgon, Cleante<br>
<br>
Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Where are you rushing?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows?<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might make sense<br>
To begin by having a conference<br>
About everything that has happened lately.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; That box of papers troubles me greatly;<br>
More than all the rest, it's cause for distress.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Why are those papers important to possess?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; My unfortunate friend Argus, when he<br>
Put them into my hands, swore me to secrecy.<br>
He chose to rely on me as he fled,<br>
And these papers, according to what he said,<br>
Are crucial to both his life and his wealth.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Then why didn't you keep them to yourself?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; It was a matter of conscience, you see,<br>
So I consulted Tartuffe in secrecy,<br>
And his arguments came to persuade me<br>
That he should keep the box for security,<br>
So I could deny having it on hand.<br>
And thus I'd have a subterfuge on demand<br>
With which my conscience might muddle through<br>
In swearing to things that I knew weren't true.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; You're in trouble, judging by appearances;<br>
Both the deed of gift and these confidences<br>
Are, to tell you my thoughts quite honestly,<br>
Measures that you took very thoughtlessly.<br>
They might put you in jail with such evidence,<br>
And since that man has it, it makes no sense<br>
To drive him away through your imprudence;<br>
You need to regain his full confidence.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; With what a fair appearance and touching zeal<br>
He hides a wicked soul and a heart of steel!<br>
And I, who received him begging and broke . . .<br>
That's it, I renounce all such pious folk.<br>
Henceforth, I will hold them as wholly evil<br>
And do my best to send them to the devil.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; It's just like you to get carried away!<br>
You can never stick to the middle way.<br>
To reason rightly is too much bother;<br>
You always rush from one excess to another.<br>
You can see your error and now you know<br>
That by a false zeal you were brought low.<br>
But to redeem yourself does logic demand<br>
That you embrace an error that's even more grand?<br>
And must you confuse the heart of a shill<br>
With the hearts of all the men of good will?<br>
Because a rascal had the luck or grace<br>
To dupe you with his austere and shining face,<br>
Must you believe everyone acts that way<br>
And no true church-man can be found today?<br>
Leave to libertines these foolish deductions.<br>
Seek true virtue, not a false deconstruction.<br>
Never rush into hasty admiration,<br>
And strive instead for moderation.<br>
If possible, don't admire false pretense,<br>
But also don't give true zeal cause for offense,<br>
And if you must fall to one extreme,<br>
Err in being too free with your esteem.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE II<br>
Damis, Orgon, Cleante<br>
<br>
Damis.</b>&nbsp; Father, is it true that this cad threatens you,<br>
That he has forgotten the gifts that bound you two,<br>
And that his shameful pride, maddeningly,<br>
Has repaid your kindness with tyranny?<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Yes, son; he's brought me to the verge of tears.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; Leave him to me.&nbsp; I'll cut off his ears.<br>
You must not flinch before his insolence<br>
For I'll soon restore your independence,<br>
And, to end the matter, I'll slice him like toast.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; That's exactly like a bratty boy's boast.<br>
Please make your angry words more moderate.<br>
We live during a time and in a state<br>
Where violent acts are clearly unlawful.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE III<br>
Madame Pernelle, Mariane, Elmire, Dorine, Damis, Orgon, Cleante<br>
<br>
Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; What's happening? The tales I'm told are awful.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Novel things have been happening to me,<br>
And for all my kindness, this is my fee.<br>
I lift the man out of his misery;<br>
Like a brother, I take him home with me;<br>
Each day I treat him with greater largesse;<br>
I give him my daughter and all I possess;<br>
And at the same time the lying low-life<br>
Looks for the best way to seduce my wife,<br>
And, not fully content with what he's achieved,<br>
He threatens me with the gifts he's received,<br>
And he wishes to use, in ruining me,<br>
Those profits he gained from my foolish bounty<br>
To drive me from the home that I gave to him<br>
And reduce me to the state that he was in.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Poor man!<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Son, I don't believe he'd allow<br>
Himself to take part in actions so foul.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; How's that?<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People always resent holy men.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Mother, what were you trying to say just then?<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; That in your home one sees the strangest things;<br>
Among them is the hate that envy brings.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; How is it hate when I've told you the truth?<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; I warned you often when you were a youth:<br>
In this world virtue is oppressed forever;<br>
The envious may die, but envy never.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; But what does this have to do with today?<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; People are telling you lies and hearsay.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I've already said that I myself saw it.<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; The malice of gossips is infinite.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; You'll make me damn myself, Mother.&nbsp; I tell you<br>
I saw with my eyes just what he would do.<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; Some tongues always have some poison to spit,<br>
And nothing on earth is safe against it.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I do not know what these words of yours mean.<br>
I've seen it, I say, seen, with these eyes seen--<br>
Do you know the word, seen?&nbsp; Must I shout it<br>
In your ears a hundred times and still you doubt it?<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; Dear Lord!&nbsp; Appearances may be deceiving:<br>
You shouldn't judge based on what you're perceiving.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I'll go mad!<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are prone to suspicion;<br>
Misjudgment is part of the human condition.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; So I must interpret charitably<br>
His desire to cuckold me?<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't you see<br>
That to accuse a man you need just cause,<br>
And until you're quite sure, you ought to pause.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; To be more certain, what would you advise?<br>
Should I have waited until before my eyes<br>
He had . . . You'll make me say something quite lewd.<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; I'm sure that a holy zeal has imbued<br>
His soul, and I can't begin to believe<br>
That he would be willing to cheat or deceive.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Leave me . . . I'm now so angry that if you<br>
Were not my mother, I'm not sure what I'd do.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>].&nbsp; This is fair payment, sir, for what we received.<br>
You wouldn't believe us; now you're not believed.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; We are wasting time on foolish pleasures<br>
That would be better spent in active measures.<br>
We should not ignore this swindler's threats.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Does his boldness have no boundaries yet?<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; For myself, I don't believe it's possible;<br>
His ingratitude would be too visible.<br>
<b>Cleante</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>].&nbsp; Don't put your faith in that.&nbsp; He will find ways<br>
To gild with reason all the things he says;<br>
And with less than this the people in power<br>
Have forced their foes to cringe and cower.<br>
I tell you again: well-armed as they are,<br>
You should never have pushed him quite so far.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; True, but what could I do?&nbsp;&nbsp; Facing that bastard,<br>
I felt resentment that I never mastered.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; I deeply desire to arrange between you<br>
Some shadow of peace, however untrue.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; If I had known that he possessed such arms,<br>
I would never have set off these alarms,<br>
And my . . .<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>to Dorine, seeing Monsieur Loyal enter</i>].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this man want?&nbsp; Go and see.<br>
I don't wish to have anyone meet with me!<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE IV<br>
Monsieur Loyal, Madame Pernelle, Orgon, Damis, Mariane, Dorine, Elmire, Cleante<br>
<br>
Monsieur Loyal</b> [<i>to Dorine</i>].&nbsp; Hello, my dear sister.&nbsp; Could you please see<br>
If your master is in?<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has company,<br>
And I doubt he'll be able to see you now.<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp; I have not come here to cause a row.<br>
I don't think that my presence will displease<br>
Him; I come, in fact, to put him at ease.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Your name?<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell him only that I've come here<br>
For Monsieur Tartuffe, and to give him cheer.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>].&nbsp; It's a man who has come quite civilly,<br>
On behalf of Monsieur Tartuffe, to see,<br>
He says, to your pleasure.<br>
<b>Cleante</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'd best find out<br>
Who he is and what he has come here about.<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>to Cleante</i>].&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he has come here to reconcile us.<br>
How should I act and what should we discuss?<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Don't let any of your anger appear,<br>
And if he speaks of a deal, make him be clear.<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>].&nbsp; Greetings, sir.&nbsp; May God destroy all your foes<br>
And favor you as much as I propose!<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>aside to Cleante</i>].&nbsp; This civil start meets my approbation<br>
And foreshadows some accommodation.<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp; At one time I was your father's employee,<br>
And this whole house is very dear to me.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I ask your pardon, sir, but to my shame<br>
I'm totally ignorant of your name.<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp; My name is Loyal.&nbsp; I come from Normandy.<br>
I'm the bailiff here, in spite of envy.<br>
For the last forty years, thanks be to God,<br>
I've done my duty and retained by job.<br>
And I've come to you, with your permission,<br>
To serve this notice of your eviction.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; What!&nbsp; You're here . . .<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's have no irritation.<br>
This is nothing more than notification,<br>
An order to evict both you and yours,<br>
Put your furniture out and lock the doors,<br>
Without pardon or delay to fulfill . . .<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Me!&nbsp; Leave this place?<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, monsieur, if you will.<br>
This house now belongs, I have ample proof,<br>
To your very good friend, Monsieur Tartuffe.<br>
He is master and lord of all your wealth<br>
By virtue of a deed he showed me himself.<br>
It is in due form and cannot be doubted.<br>
<b>Damis</b> [<i>to Monsieur Loyal</i>].&nbsp; What impudence!&nbsp; I'm amazed about it.<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal</b> [<i>to Damis</i>].&nbsp; You and I, sir, have no business and you'd<br>
Best leave things to this man [<i>pointing to Orgon</i>], who's civil and shrewd,<br>
And knows too well the duties of my office<br>
To wish to oppose himself to justice.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; But . . .<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>].&nbsp; I know that not even a million<br>
Dollars would make you cause a rebellion,<br>
And that you will be an honest citizen<br>
And let me fulfill the orders I'm given.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; You may soon feel upon your black soutane,<br>
Monsieur Bailiff, the heavy weight of this cane.<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>]. Command your son to be quiet or depart,<br>
Monsieur; I would regret to have to report<br>
All this and make these matters more official.<br>
<b>Damis</b> [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; This Monsieur Loyal seems quite disloyal!<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp; For all worthy men there's a place in my heart,<br>
And I would not have wished, sir, to take part<br>
In this, except to lift some of your burden,<br>
By preventing the chore from falling to one<br>
Who might not share my opinion of you<br>
And who wouldn't proceed as gently as I do.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; And what could be worse than the evil crime<br>
Of evicting me?<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm giving you time,<br>
And until morning I'll hold in abeyance<br>
The execution of this conveyance.<br>
I shall only come here with ten of my boys<br>
To spend the night, without scandal or noise.<br>
For the sake of form please bring to me, before<br>
You go up to bed, the keys to your door.<br>
I'll take care not to disrupt your repose<br>
And not to do anything you would oppose.<br>
But tomorrow morning you must get set<br>
To empty the house, down to the last brochette.<br>
My boys will assist you.&nbsp; Each one's a strong lout<br>
And will do all he can to help move you out.<br>
I'm doing my best to use common sense,<br>
And, since I'm treating you with such indulgence,<br>
I beg you, sir, to act the same way to me.<br>
Let no one bar me from doing my duty.<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>aside</i>].&nbsp; With a happy heart I would at once pay<br>
The last hundred francs that are mine today<br>
For the power and pleasure of hitting his snout<br>
With one absolutely sensational clout.<br>
<b>Cleante</b> [<i>quietly, to Orgon</i>].<br>
Go easy, don't make things worse.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My hand itches<br>
To get in a fight with these sons of bitches.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Monsieur Loyal, I think it might become you<br>
To have your broad back beaten black and blue.<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp; These wicked words deserve condemnation,<br>
And women, too, may earn incarceration.<br>
<b>Cleante</b> [<i>to Monsieur Loyal</i>].&nbsp; Let's end it now; that's enough for today.<br>
Hand over the paper, and be on your way.<br>
<b>Monsieur Loyal.</b>&nbsp; Until later, then.&nbsp; Heaven keep you in joy!<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; May it confound you, and your employer!<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE V<br>
Orgon, Cleante, Mariane, Elmire, Madame Pernelle, Dorine, Damis<br>
<br>
Orgon.</b>&nbsp; There!&nbsp; You now see, mother, that I was right,<br>
And you can judge of the rest by this writ.<br>
Do you admit at last that he can lie?<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp; It's as if a bolt has struck from the sky.<br>
<b>Dorine</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>].&nbsp; You're wrong to complain, and wrong to blame him.<br>
These things show the grand plans of your seraphim.<br>
His neighborly love finds consummation<br>
In proving that wealth causes degradation,<br>
And from pure charity he wants to remove<br>
Every obstacle between you and God's love.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Shut up. . . . I'm always saying that to you.<br>
<b>Cleante</b> [<i>to Orgon</i>].&nbsp; Let us consider what we ought to do.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; We must expose this man's insolent acts.<br>
His deeds invalidate all the contracts.<br>
And his disloyalty will seem too plain<br>
If he tries to use them for personal gain.<br>
<br>
<b>SCENE VI<br>
Valere, Orgon, Cleante, Elmire, Mariane, Madame Pernelle, Damis, Dorine<br>
<br>
Valere.</b>&nbsp; I'm sorry, sir, that I've come to distress you;<br>
But certain dangers may soon oppress you.<br>
A friend, whose love for me is deep and true<br>
And who knows how much I care about you,<br>
Has had enough courage to violate<br>
The secrecy of affairs of state<br>
And has just now sent me word that you might<br>
Be well-advised to take sudden flight.<br>
The villain who has been imposing on you<br>
Has gone to the Prince to accuse you too,<br>
And put into his hands, like a blade of hate,<br>
The vital papers of a traitor of State,<br>
Which he says that you've kept in secrecy<br>
Despite the duties of aristocracy.<br>
I don't know the details of the alleged crime,<br>
But a warrant against you has been signed,<br>
And he himself is assigned to assist<br>
Those who will soon come to make the arrest.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; Now his claims are well-armed; and the ingrate<br>
Seeks to become master of your estate.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I swear, that man is a vile animal!<br>
<b>Valere.</b>&nbsp; The slightest trifling could well be fatal.<br>
My coach is right here to take you away<br>
With a thousand louis that I've pledged to pay.<br>
Don't lose any time; the arrow has sped,<br>
And this is one blow that ought to be fled.<br>
I myself will guide you to a safe place<br>
And will stay with you to be sure there's no chase.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; I owe you much for your solicitude!<br>
But there isn't time for my gratitude,<br>
And I pray to God to grant what I need<br>
So that one day I may repay this good deed.<br>
Farewell.&nbsp; The rest of you take care . . .<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go on.<br>
We'll look after everything when you're gone.<br>
<br>
<b>Final Scene<br>
Police Officer, Tartuffe, Valere, Orgon, Elmire, Mariane, Madame Pernelle, Cleante, Damis, Dorine<br>
<br>
Tartuffe</b> [<i>stopping Orgon</i>].&nbsp; Slowly, slowly, sir.&nbsp; You needn't run there.<br>
You won't have to go far to hide in your lair.<br>
In the Prince's name we will shackle you fast.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Traitor, you've kept this final shaft for last.<br>
This is the blow with which you dispatch me,<br>
And this is what crowns all your perfidy.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Your scorn causes me scant irritation;<br>
I bear it as a holy obligation.<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; This is scant sign of your moderation.<br>
<b>Damis.</b>&nbsp; How impudently the wretch mocks veneration!<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; None of your outbursts mean a thing to me,<br>
For I think of nothing but doing my duty.<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp; Your pretense to honor is all a fake,<br>
And this is just the right job for you to take.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; The task can only shower me with grace<br>
Since our Prince's command has sent me to this place.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; But don't you recall how my charity<br>
Raised you, you ingrate, from your misery?<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Yes, I know that I once received assistance,<br>
But my duty to the Prince demands this persistence:<br>
'Tis a sacred duty of such fortitude<br>
That it has suppressed all my gratitude,<br>
And I would sacrifice to this powerful force<br>
Friends, wife, parents, and myself, of course.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; The hypocrite!<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How well he can create<br>
A treacherous cloak from all we venerate!<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp; But if this zeal which drives you, and with which<br>
You plume yourself, lifts you to a holy niche,<br>
Why is it that it didn't come to life<br>
Until after he caught you with his wife,<br>
And why did you only denounce him today<br>
After honor made him chase you away?<br>
I don't claim that the gift of all his estates<br>
Ought to distract you from duty's dictates,<br>
But if you planned to reveal his treason here,<br>
Why were you willing to take his wealth back there?<br>
<b>Tartuffe</b> [<i>to the Officer</i>].&nbsp; From all this noise, sir, please deliver me,<br>
And be so kind as to enforce your decree.<br>
<b>Police Officer.</b>&nbsp; Yes, I've been rather slow to issue it.<br>
Your own mouth aptly invites me to do it;<br>
And so it will be done if you will come<br>
Straight to the jail that will be your new home.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Me, sir?<br>
<b>Police Officer.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, you.<br>
<b>Tartuffe.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why to prison?<br>
<b>Police Office.</b>&nbsp; I need not explain to you my reason.<br>
[<i>To Orgon.</i>]&nbsp; Calm yourself, sir, after passions of such heat.<br>
We're ruled by a Prince who's a foe to deceit,<br>
A Prince whose eyes can read what the soul has writ,<br>
And who can't be fooled by a hypocrite.<br>
Blessed with a fine discernment, his great heart<br>
Always sees the whole picture, not just each part.<br>
Nothing can drive him to exaggeration;<br>
His firm reason clings to moderation.<br>
He confers on men of worth immortal glory;<br>
But that zeal is not blind or peremptory,<br>
And his love for what's true does not turn his eye<br>
From the power of falseness to horrify.<br>
This man here was unable to entrap him;<br>
His defenses are sound when such snares enwrap him.<br>
From the start, he pierced with his perceptive sight<br>
Through the veils that hid this evil from light.<br>
Tartuffe betrayed himself by accusing you,<br>
And, in divine justice, revealed his true<br>
Colors to the Prince as an infamous cad<br>
Whose deeds under another name were so bad<br>
That the record they made was wholly black<br>
And Satan might use them as his almanac.<br>
In short, this king was revolted to see<br>
His ingratitude to you and disloyalty;<br>
To his other crimes, he has joined this one<br>
And has only allowed it so everyone<br>
Could see his audacity's evil ends<br>
And then see him required to make amends.<br>
All your papers, which the wretch has pawed through,<br>
Are here taken away and returned to you.<br>
With his sovereign power he will abrogate<br>
The contract by which you gave away your estate,<br>
And finally he pardons that secret offense<br>
Which you once committed through benevolence.<br>
This is the reward for the courage you showed<br>
In support of his rights in the late episode,<br>
And to demonstrate that, when least expected,<br>
One's past deeds may be recollected,<br>
That he will never forget a good deed,<br>
And that good outweighs evil in time of need.<br>
<b>Dorine.</b>&nbsp; Heaven be praised!<br>
<b>Madame Pernelle.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're no longer distressed.<br>
<b>Elmire.</b>&nbsp; What a happy ending!<br>
<b>Mariane.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who could have guessed?<br>
<b>Orgon</b> [<i>to Tartuffe, whom the Officer is leading away</i>].<br>
Good.&nbsp; There you go, traitor . . .<br>
<b>Cleante.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Brother, cease,<br>
And don't degenerate to indignities.<br>
Leave to himself this miserable clown,<br>
And don't add to the remorse that weighs him down.<br>
Hope instead that his heart may one day<br>
Make a happy return to the virtuous way,<br>
That he'll reform his life and lament his past,<br>
And cause our great Prince to temper justice at last.<br>
You should throw yourself on your knees in praise<br>
Of the kindness and lenience shown these days.<br>
<b>Orgon.</b>&nbsp; Yes, that's well said.&nbsp; Let us kneel down with joy<br>
And praise the kind deeds of his envoy.<br>
Then, having acquitted part of our duty,<br>
Let's turn to address the claims of beauty,<br>
And by a fine wedding crown in Valere<br>
A lover who's both generous and sincere.<br>
<br>
<b>THE END</b><br></p>
